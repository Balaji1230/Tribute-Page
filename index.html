    <h3>Here's a time line of Walt Disney</h3>
    
    <ul>
    <li><p>In 1921, American animators Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks founded Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri.</p></li>
    <li><p>Iwerks and Disney went on to create several short films at the studio. The final one, created in 1923, was entitled Alice's Wonderland and  depicted child actor Virginia Davis  <br>interacting with animated characters.</p></li>
    <li><p>Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy Disney as Disney Brothers Studio; it also operated under the names Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions before changing its name to 
    The Walt Disney Company in 1986.</p></li>
    <li><p>After becoming a major success by the early 1940s, the company diversified into live-action films, television, and theme parks in the 1950s</p></li>

    <center><h3><u>The History and Evolution of the Disney Logo</u></h3> </center>
    <br>
<h3><u>1929 - 1937</u></h3>
<center><img src="logo1.png" alt=""></center>
<p>The First Disney logo featured Mickey Mouse front and center. It was by far their busiest, most crammed logo. There was a lot going on. Their mascot’s name was written on either side of the drawing, while “Walt Disney Productions” and the address framed the top and bottom of the design. </p>
<br>
<h3><u>1937 - 1948</u></h3>
<center><img src="logo2.png" alt=""></center>
<p>The Second redesign looks almost nothing like the first logo. The beloved Mickey Mouse mascot was gone, along with all the other inscriptions. Instead, the logo just featured the name of the founder in a creative script font. The script looks like it was drawn by hand, just like the method used to create animations back then. </p>
<br>
<h3><u>1985 - 2006</u></h3>
<center><img src="logo3.png" alt=""></center>
<p>Walt Disney’s world famous castle made its debut on the 1984 logo redesign. It was placed above the wordmark, which remains unchanged from the previous design. The castle was cut in several horizontal lines. A thin arch over the castle is left by the star that went across the screen in the older Disney intros. </p>
